# tictactoe

A game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing
two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.

--implementation--
After certain moves the PC plays against itself as both X and O such that it can determine who has maximum chance to win the game and chooses its move.
